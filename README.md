# Regular Expression Analyzer

Code optimization tool based on finite automata and regular expressions. The primary goal is to
develop a system that takes code written in a simple programming language and optimizes it by
identifying and applying various code transformations.
 
The project will involve multiple stages,
including lexical and syntax analysis, code optimization using finite automata-based algorithms,
and the generation of an optimized intermediate code.

## Requirements

> #### â˜¼ Lexical Analysis: Develop a lexical analyser using finite automata to tokenize input.
>
> - Define regular expressions for various token types (identifiers, keywords, operators).
>
> - Implement a finite automaton for each regular expression to perform tokenization.
>
>  #### â˜¼ Syntax Analysis: Create a syntax analyser using context-free grammar to capture the language's syntax.
>
> - Design and implement context-free grammar rules.
> - Develop a finite automaton-based syntax analyser to ensure proper code structure.
>

> #### â˜¼ Code Optimization Techniques: Implement finite automata-based algorithms for common code optimization techniques (constant folding, dead code elimination, common subexpression elimination).

> - Explore and understand the theory behind finite automata-based optimization techniques.
> - Develop algorithms to identify and apply optimizations during code analysis.
